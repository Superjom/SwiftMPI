Zhu Xi or Chu Hsi -LRB- , October 18 , 1130 -- April 23 , 1200 -RRB- was a Confucian scholar during the Song Dynasty .
He was from Fujian province in China .
The Four Books
During the Song Dynasty , Zhu Xis teachings were considered to be unorthodox .
Rather than focusing on the Book of Changes like other Neo-Confucians , he chose to emphasize the Four Books : the Great Learning , the Doctrine of the Mean , the Analects of Confucius , and the Mencius as the core curriculum -LRB- thing to learn -RRB- for aspiring scholar officials .
For all these classics he wrote extensive commentaries -LRB- big reviews -RRB- that were not widely recognized in his time ; however , they later became accepted as their standard commentaries .
The Four Books served as the basis of civil service examinations all the way down to 1905 .
Chan 1963 : 589 .
Knowledge and action
According to Zhu Xi , knowledge and action were indivisible components of truly intelligent activity .
Although he did distinguish -LRB- tell apart -RRB- between the priority of knowing , since intelligent action requires forethought -LRB- thought before -RRB- , and the importance of action , as it produces a discernible effect , Zhu Xi said `` Knowledge and action always require each other .
It is like a person who can not walk without legs although he has eyes , and who can not see without eyes although he has legs .
With respect to order , knowledge comes first , and with respect to importance , action is more important . ''
