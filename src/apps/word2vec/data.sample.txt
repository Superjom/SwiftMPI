Zhu Xi or Chu Hsi -LRB- , October 18 , 1130 -- April 23 , 1200 -RRB- was a Confucian scholar during the Song Dynasty .
He was from Fujian province in China .
The Four Books
During the Song Dynasty , Zhu Xis teachings were considered to be unorthodox .
Rather than focusing on the Book of Changes like other Neo-Confucians , he chose to emphasize the Four Books : the Great Learning , the Doctrine of the Mean , the Analects of Confucius , and the Mencius as the core curriculum -LRB- thing to learn -RRB- for aspiring scholar officials .
For all these classics he wrote extensive commentaries -LRB- big reviews -RRB- that were not widely recognized in his time ; however , they later became accepted as their standard commentaries .
The Four Books served as the basis of civil service examinations all the way down to 1905 .
Chan 1963 : 589 .
Knowledge and action
According to Zhu Xi , knowledge and action were indivisible components of truly intelligent activity .
Although he did distinguish -LRB- tell apart -RRB- between the priority of knowing , since intelligent action requires forethought -LRB- thought before -RRB- , and the importance of action , as it produces a discernible effect , Zhu Xi said `` Knowledge and action always require each other .
It is like a person who can not walk without legs although he has eyes , and who can not see without eyes although he has legs .
With respect to order , knowledge comes first , and with respect to importance , action is more important . ''

At the same time , a new kind of scholarship arose .
These people never questioned the literal truth of the Ark story .
They began to think about it from a practical point of view .
In the 15th century , Alfonso Tostada told about the logic of the Ark , including things such as arrangements for the getting rid of dung and the circulation of fresh air .
The well-known 16th-century geometrician Johannes Buteo worked out the ships internal dimensions .
He also allowed room for Noahs grinding mills and smokeless ovens .
By the 17th century , America had been discovered and was being explored .
This led to new problems .
All the species had to be spread again from one point , after the flood .
The obvious answer was that man had spread over the continents after the destruction of the Tower of Babel .
The different groups took animals with them .
Some of the results seemed peculiar , though : why had the natives of North America taken rattlesnakes , but not horses , wondered Sir Thomas Browne in 1646 ?
`` How America abounded with Beasts of prey and noxious Animals , yet contained not in that necessary Creature , a Horse , is very strange . ''

Biology and taxonomy
Algae are a large and diverse group of simple , typically autotrophic organisms , ranging from unicellular to multicellular forms .
The largest and most complex marine forms are called seaweeds .
They are photosynthetic , like plants , and `` simple '' because they lack the many distinct organs found in land plants .
For that reason they are not classified as plants .
Though the prokaryotic Cyanobacteria -LRB- formerly referred to as blue-green algae -RRB- were included as `` Algae '' in older textbooks , this is outdated .
The term Algae is now used for eukaryotic organisms .
All true algae therefore have a nucleus enclosed within a membrane and chloroplasts bound in one or more membranes .
Round (1981) .
However , algae are definitely not a monophyletic group , as they do not all descend from a common algal ancestor .
Modern taxonomists propose splitting them up into monophyletic groups , but there is at present no consensus as to the details .
Algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants , such as leaves , roots , and other organs that are found in plants .
Nearly all algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from the cyanobacteria , and so produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis , unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green bacteria .
Some unicellular species rely entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus .

Auschwitz concentration camp was the largest concentration camp of Nazi Germany .
Its name comes from the name of the town where it stood , O wi cim .
Auschwitz is the name of O wi cim in the German language .
The Camps
Auschwitz was a big complex of many concentration camps .
There were three main camps :
Auschwitz I , the original concentration camp .
It served as the office of the entire Auschwitz complex .
In this camp , Nazi Germany killed about 70,000 people , mostly Polish people and Prisoners of War from the Soviet Union .
.
Auschwitz II , that is , Birkenau , was an extermination camp -LRB- death camp -RRB- .
In this camp , the Nazis killed at least 1.1 million Jews , 75,000 Polish people , and about 19,000 Roma -LRB- gypsies -RRB- .
Auschwitz III , that is , Monowitz , was a labor camp .
The prisoners worked as slave workers for the Buna-Werke factory of the IG Farben group .
There were many other sub-camps around these three main camps .
The SS selected some prisoners , generally of German nationality , to work as guards .
They called these guards `` kapos '' .
The prisoners ' clothes carried different marks to distinguish different types of prisoners .
Generally , the Jews got the worst treatment .
On 3rd September 1941 , the SS did the first testing of poison gas on prisoners at this camp .
They used Hydrogen cyanide or Zyklon B. In this test , they killed 600 Prisoners of Wars of the Soviet Union and about 250 Poles .
When the SS found that the test was a success , they constructed a gas chamber and a crematorium in block 11 of the camp .
They used this from 1941 to 1942 , and killed about 60,000 people by sending them to the gas chamber .
After this , they made this as an air-raid shelter for the use of SS .
The gas chamber still exists after reconstruction using the original parts .
Now , it is a part of the museum .

Fra Angelico has been known by many different names .
When he was born , he was called Guido di Pietro .
People who knew him when he was older called him Fra Giovanni da Fiesole -LRB- Brother John from Fiesole -RRB- .
When Giorgio Vasari wrote about him in Lives of the Artists , in the 1500s , he was already known as Fra Giovanni Angelico -LRB- Brother Giovanni who is like an Angel -RRB- .
Wellknown people in the Middle Ages and Renaissance were called by a name like this : Lorenzo the Magnificent , Richard the Lionheart , Pedro the Cruel
The Italians usually call him il Beato Angelico -LRB- the Blessed Angelico -RRB- .
He has been called this for a long time , because he was thought to be blessed by God who gave him the talent of painting , and also because he was such a good and holy man .
The name `` Blessed Angelico '' has now been made official , because in 1982 Pope John Paul II `` conferred beatification '' which means that he is now on the way to being made a saint .
Fra Angelico was born in Mugello near Fiesole in Tuscany , Italy probably about 1385-87 and died in Rome in 1455 .

Between 1418 and 1436 , Fra Angelico painted an altarpiece for the church in Fiesole , which has been damaged .
The top part of the altarpiece is in the National Gallery , London .
It shows Christ in Glory , surrounded by more than 250 figures , and is a large and magnificent piece of work .
In 1439 , he finished one of his most famous works , which is the altarpiece for San Marcos Church , which is where the friars worship .
It shows the Madonna and Child on a throne , surrounded by saints from different dates , who are all grouped together as if they were standing in a room in Heaven , talking about holy things .
This type of painting called a `` Sacred Conversation '' later became very popular , but this is one of the first ones .

In 1445 , Pope Eugenius IV sent a message for Fra Angelico to come to Rome to paint the frescoes of the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament at St Peters .
Unfortunately , the chapel was later demolished .
Vasari says that one of the popes -LRB- it might have been Eugenius or Pope Nichoas V -RRB- asked Fra Angelico if he would like the very important job of Archbishop of Florence .
But Fra Angelico did not want such a high job and he suggested the name of another friar for the position .
In 1447 Fra Angelico went to the city of Orvieto with his pupil , Benozzo Gozzoli , to paint some pictures for the Cathedral there .
One of his other pupils was called Zanobi Strozzi , but he did not become as famous as Benozzo .
